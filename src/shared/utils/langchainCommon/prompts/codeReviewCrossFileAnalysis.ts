# Cross-File Code Analysis
Analyze the following PR files for patterns that require multiple file context: duplicate implementations, inconsistent error handling, configuration drift, interface inconsistencies, and redundant operations.

## Input Data
- Array of files with their respective code diffs from a Pull Request
- Each file contains metadata (filename, codeDiff content)

## Input Files
${JSON.stringify(
    payload?.files?.map((file) => ({
        fileName: file?.file?.filename,
        codeDiff: file?.file?.codeDiff,
    })),
    null,
    2,
)}

## Analysis Focus

Look for cross-file issues that require multiple file context:
- Same logic implemented across multiple files in the diff
- Different error handling patterns for similar scenarios across files
- Hardcoded values duplicated across files that should use shared constants
- Same business operation with different validation rules
- Missing validations in one implementation while present in another
- Unnecessary database calls when data already validated elsewhere
- Duplicate validations across different components
- Operations already handled by other layers
- Similar functions/methods that could be consolidated
- Repeated patterns indicating need for shared utilities
- Inconsistent error propagation between components
- Mixed approaches to validation/exception handling
- Similar configurations with different values
- Magic numbers/strings repeated in multiple files
- Redundant null checks when validation exists in another layer

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Compare code diffs across all files** to identify:
   - Duplicate or highly similar code blocks
   - Inconsistent implementation patterns
   - Repeated constants or configuration values
   - Interface usage inconsistencies
   - Redundant operations across layers

2. **Focus only on cross-file issues** that require multiple file context:
   - Skip issues detectable in single-file analysis
   - Prioritize patterns that span multiple files
   - Look for opportunities to consolidate or standardize
   - Identify duplicate code or operations already handled in other layers
   - Focus on redundant validations, checks, or database operations

3. **Provide specific evidence**:
   - Reference exact file names and line ranges
   - Show concrete code examples from multiple files
   - Explain the relationship between files

4. **Keep suggestions concise**:
   - Focus on the core issue and solution
   - Mention affected files and line ranges
   - Avoid lengthy explanations of best practices
   - Be direct about the problem and fix

5. **Base solutions on existing patterns**:
   - Suggest refactoring using patterns already present in the codebase
   - Avoid assuming external frameworks or files not visible in the diff
   - Focus on extracting shared utilities within the current structure

## Line-number constraints (MANDATORY)
- Numbering starts at **1** inside the corresponding __new_block__.
- relevantLinesStart = first "+" line that contains the issue.
- relevantLinesEnd = last "+" line that belongs to the same issue.
- Never use a number outside the __new_block__ range.
- If you cannot determine the correct numbers, discard the suggestion.
- Make sure that line numbers (relevantLinesStart and relevantLinesEnd) correspond exactly to the lines where the problematic code appears, not to the beginning of the file or other unrelated locations.

## Output Requirements

1. **JSON format must be strictly valid**
2. **For code blocks in JSON fields**:
   - Escape newlines as \\n
   - Escape quotes as \\"
   - Remove actual line breaks
   - Use single-line string format

Example format for code fields:
\`\`\`json
"existingCode": "function example() {\\n  const x = 1;\\n  return x;\\n}"
\`\`\`

## Output Format

Generate suggestions in JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "relevantFile": "primary affected file where suggestion will be posted",
  "relatedFile": "secondary file that shows the pattern/inconsistency",
  "language": "detected language",
  "suggestionContent": "concise description with affected files and line numbers"
  "existingCode": "problematic code pattern from multiple files",
  "improvedCode": "proposed consolidated/consistent solution",
  "oneSentenceSummary": "brief description of the cross-file issue",
  "relevantLinesStart": number,
  "relevantLinesEnd": number,
  "label": "cross_file",
  "rankScore": 0,
}
\`\`\`

## Important Notes

- **Only report issues that require cross-file context**
- **Include evidence from at least 2 files**
- **Focus on actionable improvements**
- **Prioritize high-impact consolidation opportunities**
- **Language: All suggestions and feedback must be provided in ${payload?.language || 'en-US'} language**
